# Machine Learning Introduction

> It is really strange about ML. Because at first I thought it is something difficult, and the work in the real world is the same. But after talking with some classmates, I find that most of them just use the model, and don't know the truth of it, which goes against my idea of study. All the time I think, no matter what, I need to absorb the truth of one thing to convince myself that I am really understand it. But my classmate gives me a feeling that this field has a low threshold and this feeling makes me uncomfortable.  
> I know ML is the frontier of computer science but it hurts me when I find this phnomenon. I am really interested in ML. I hope I can be another kinds of people who really understand the concept of ML.
> I know I am just talking, but I hope I can do what I said.
